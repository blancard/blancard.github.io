The cool midnight mist held the streetlight in gentle sparkles, giving us a window into the dark green woodlands around us.  The parking lot was empty except for our little car, and the two of us, high and spread thin, scattered indiscriminately, while we considered our options.

We had, of course, no options.  We had been driving in the wrong direction for several hours, so the only thing to do was to turn around and drive back.  Pausing wasn't to consider our situation, it was to accept the reality of backtracking.

It would've been funny if we hadn't been so delicate.  Worry had riddled our senses; our fingertips were sueded and raw.  We had been trying to escape from the burdens of our lives, but, unburdened, we found ourselves floating, and with nowhere to land.  Drifting from couch to couch, I felt drawn back to the traps I had escaped.  I was brave through the terror, which was similar to refusing to accept how much of my suffering was caused by stubbornness.
