The Repos were back.  I could hear them slamming open the doors at the end of the cellblock.  Boisterous and viscious, their cruel, sarcastic laughter echoed above the low, insane grumbling of the prisoners that were still alive.  

They did this every dew days.  They trawled down the block, mocking and taunting us.  None of the others had enough sense to ignore them.

Tonight they were offering a deal.  Freedom to anyone who would simply reach out, between the bars, and shake their hands.  If it was a genuine deal, why were they laughing?  Slavering, cruel laughter.  They didn't know how to open the cell doors - if they did, they would've done it years ago.  

The timid, insane man in the cell opposite mine crept forward.  He hadn't made an intelligible sound as long as I could remember.  While he managed to survive, he lost coherence quite early.  That might've been how he had managed to survive.  It wasn't hard to survive.  You just had to be willing to do what you had to do.  I was young enough not to know you weren't supposed to eat live rats and roaches.  The older ones were dominated, and killed, by their revulsion.  I just didn't know any better.
