This started as a sober rewrite of N and J, but then became someone else.  Then I got depressed because I realized that by imaginging a person's fantasy like that, you're depicting the opposite as their reality, and this was my kid, so, dark af.

Max took Eric's hand.  He was 4, he shouldn't need her so much.  She loved him very much, but patience was not among her many gifts.  He would've just stood there staring at the leaves for days, but she was already bored of them.  She pulled him along.  

Her tug on his arm pulled his attention down from the treetops.  Satisfied he would follow, she turned back towards her destination and, with a determined mindset, loudly trampled their way through the leaves and twigs on the forest floor.  Eric didn't speak very well.  She wished she could talk to him the way her friends talked to their brothers and sisters.  She did anyway, but, she supposed, she just wished he understood.

Having irritated their mother, they had been ejected into the woods shortly after breakfast.  Max didn't mind; she had a secret in the forest that only she and Eric knew - and Eric wasn't telling.  

They descended a hill and found the tiny creek that was the source of magic.  All along the shores of the creek, her city bustled and thrived.  Children would be on their way to school by now, parents on their way to work.  It was a Tuesday.  She helped Eric to an area of the city that he could play with, and, comfortable that he wouldn't be too destructive, she got to work on the light rail system that she had been planning.

Betty was the first through the train doors when they opened.  She dropped her skateboard to the ground and rolled off the platform, landing gracefully on the sidewalk below.  

"Nice jump!"

"Thanks!" she yelled back.

She kickflipped off the curb and crossed the into the center of the street.  A taxi honked angrily at her.  

"Get out of the street, kid!"

"It's my street as much as yours, buddy!" She waved happily at the driver. 

Another skateboarder, a young man, hopped down the curb and joined her in the street.  He was trying his best to look cool, to get her attention, but she wasn't interested.  She had a lot to do, places to go, and besides, he was pushing mongo.  "Never push mongo, not even switch!" she yelled at him.  She pushed herself faster and left him in the dust.

She ollied through the door of a coffeeshop just as someone else was opening the door.  "Thank you!!!" She waved, and rolled to a stop right in front of the counter.  

"A large coffee, please!" 

"Sure thing!"  They filled her black, stickered travel mug, and she was back on the street.  The library wasn't far; she enjoyed the cool breeze on her face as she rushed to work.

She made her way to her cubicle.  Johnny was already at work, sitting in the next cubicle.  She gave him a hug.  "How are you today?"  She didn't wait for an answer, he wasn't going to answer.  "I jumped down from the train platform today and landed it, that's the first time!  I'm going to have to start working in a kickflip or something.  Last night I heard back about the book I'm writing, and it sounds like the publisher is interested! So that's great."  He smiled. 

Regulus, Johnny's boss, came up, and started hassling him about something.  "Johnny, that TPS report had a lot of errors, I can't have you making so many mistakes, ok?"

Something roared inside Max's chest.  Her claws retracted and she prepared to attack.  Regulus wandered off, and Max felt the sharp edge of the rage disolve into her bloodstream.  It wasn't gone. It was never gone.  It was simply sleeping again.  

Betty gave Johnny a small smile and promised to help him with the next TPS report.
