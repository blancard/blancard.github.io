I woke to the sound of thick metal clanging against the bars.  Not my bars; I knew that right away; the sound was more distant than that, probably down at the north end of the cellblock.  The clang repeated, as if arpeggiating along the cells.  

Voices carried just below the metal tang, slavering, slobbering voices, senseless and cruel.  Vicious.  I suppose this was presumptuous, but I knew these voices.  It was around the same time, almost every night.  I didn’t know who they were, who they were before, or what they had become, but, in the absence of information, I was able to assess them by their actions.  Even now, years later, I am unable to muster any sympathy for them.

The loudest, the meanest, the one who was obviously in charge, laughed raucously, as he always did, as he made an offer he made frequently.  It would have been boring if it weren’t so repugnant.  

Once upon a time, there was a man across from me.  He was never particularly nice to me, though at the time I was too young to understand what that meant.  In those early days, when I was so afraid, when my throat was sore from sobbing, I don’t recall a soft condolence, a gentle word, an extension of humanity - but, again, I didn’t know that he probably should have.  He was terrified, as I was, but, with greater context, he had reason to be even more afraid than I was.  

He slipped into madness.  Many of them did.  All of them, I guess.  He started to ramble rationalizations and explanations, but as the days became weeks and months, they began to drip between the cracks in sense until every thought was fiction.  When he resurfaced, when he learned how to survive, he was a scarecrow, a thin reed, made up, as I later understood, of some of the most resilient stuff on earth.  But that resilience grows from the mind, and once it’s forgotten what it can do, the resilience is gone.

He skittered and muttered, sideways, like a crab, around his cell, timid and wary of the light, with, luckily, animalistic intelligence and insight.   These were not, some part of him knew, creatures with which it was wise to fuck.  However, occasionally, a person would return near the surface of him - never breaking through and gasping, only as if admiring the light that shone through.  I didn’t really give a shit, even when he spoke directly at me.  Neither did I give a shit when that evening’s conjuncture ended it for him.  

As the waving light of the Red Men’s lantern cast unshadows down the cellblock, instead of retreating to the corners, he pressed his gaunt face to the bars, his scraggly thicket of beard ejecting dangerously into the aisle.  

The loudest, the meanest, the front one, told us, as he was wont to, that he would let us out if only we would extend a hand in gratitude.  He just wanted to shake the hand of the person he would free, he said.  

People who interact with people who are trustworthy tend to trust as an initial response.  I had, from what I remember, never interacted with someone I could trust.  Trust wasn’t a word I knew, or, if it was, it wasn’t a word with a definition that made sense.  Why would I believe the words this thing was saying?  Why did this thing that used to be the man across from me, suddenly, after years, believe him?  

He reached out his arm, through the bars, into the bright, wavy light of the aisle.  His gesture was met by loud, genuine cheers.  With one, balletic, sweeping motion, the one in front swung a machete down, chopping the arm off at the shoulder.  He reached for the arm and grabbed it at the wrist, and swung it tentatively, as though testing its weight.  He swung it like a club against the bars, where it thudded dully against them.  It wiggled in his grip; a lifeless arm is a floppy thing.  

Then, something happened.  Something happened which had never happened before, which was, itself, something had never happened before.  Everything had always been the same and now one thing happened that would change everything.  Nothing that had ever happened would ever happen again.  The lights came on. 

The brightness hurt.  My eyes squinted almost shut, and peering through my fingers, I could just make out the Red One in Front.  He was also covering his eyes and squinting, looking hard down to the far end of the hall.  His speech was slow and loud; his posture was forward-thrust and menacing.

"What the fuck.  Is that a girl?  I see you've brought some toys…  You gotta be careful around here, little girl, some real bad types…  why don't you bring those down here and we'll take you someplace safe."

His hard, cruel face softened, his posture weakened.  The block was otherwise silent; it was easy to hear the clinking and kershlacking coming from the far end.  His boast was purposeful now; before it had been only habit.  This was genuine fear.  "You can't get us all.  Hundreds of us.   Ain't none of us'r nice."  Silence.  It did not reassure him; despite his attempts to squeeze himself tight, he was still deflating.  "We got 5 of crews around these blocks."

She spoke.  The first words I ever heard her say.  Appropriate; portentous.  Her voice sounded odd to me then, female, for sure, but it didn't waver in fear or vibrate from rage.  It was a sensible voice.  A voice with a sureness beyond confidence.  Her voice and, by extension, her, it seemed, were filled with fact; and the Red Ones were right to be afraid, for she would prove to be just as brutal.  "Not anymore."

The block was flooded with gunfire.  The one in front shook and twisted as he was destroyed by the bullets.  Violent screams joined the relentless percussion.  She didn't stop until all the screams had gurgled to silence.  A few heavy clunks and then, world-shatteringly, the cell doors bgan to open.  All of the doors were opening at once, sliding sideways in a once-familiar motion, though, after years of stillness, they groaned reluctantly.  The sound was deafening, and yet the awe, the shock, the shatter, within however many minds remained, seemed to suck it in and consume it, like a black hole. 

Heavy, confident footfalls came down the block.  I did not approach my cell door; there was no reason to think that this person would be any more benevolent than the red ones.  I heard several people shrieking incoherently, probably as she passed. Soon I saw her.  She was looking into each cell with a grim expression.  

She was only a little taller than me, but clearly very strong.  Her sweaty, dirty tanktop clung to a well-muscled torso; her arms were wrapped in thick, round muscles, woven with pulsing veins.  around her shouuders were slung several large guns; around her belt there were tools and knives and other tough-looking equipment.  Her hair was dark and short, and appeared as though it had been cut with garden shears (which it probably was).  If it weren't for her fine features and prominent breasts, she might've been confused for a man.

When she finally looked into mine, she saw me instantly.  "Hey.  You ok?"  I didn't respond, but I suppose she made some inferences based on the things I didn't do--namely, I didn't react in the obviously insane way others had.  She extended a hand to me.  "Come with me."  I didn't move.  "More of them will come.  I'm your only hope.  Come with me if you want to live."

Did I want to live?  I wasn't sure.  But I decided to take Pascal's approach.  I knew she was right. I didn't trust her, at least, not in the way I do now, but I knew that I didn't have the slightest idea how to evade the red ones, much less how to survive if I did.  I didn't even remember what outside looked like.  

I got up and approached her.  Her hand remained outstretched, steady, and solid.  I slid my wisterian hand into her warm, strong grip.  Her hands were thick and strong.  She held my hand like I was a child, and after giving the rest of the cells a once-over, she shook her head, and we went out the way she had come.

I hadn't been out of that cell in a long time.  Years, I later discovered.  7 years.  I vaguely remembered the hallway that lead into the cellblock, where men in white coats lead me to and from my cell.  The hallway had been clean and white.  Where the hall turned, where it lead to the testing chambers and medical offices, I recalled there being a white emergency exit, with a small window from which, at my height, showed only the sky.  Today, the hallway was dark and moldy, the walls chipped and broken.  The door, once unopenable, had been forced open by weeds, weeds which were now trunks and branches.  

At the time, I only had a vague idea of what had happened.  I had lived in that place for as long as I could remember, and my days were extremely consistent: tests, machines, treatments, examinations, and, of course, my cell.  But at some point things had changed.  I would have gaps in my schedule.  I would spend time in my cell when normally I wouldn't.  Out sick, I was told.  The gaps got longer and longer, until it became quite rare to see anyone at all.  One man, whose face I can almost remember, was the last one.  He brought us food, until one day, when he didn't.  

I learned to survive quickly, as did everyone else on the block.  It didn't take long for the rats and roaches to reclaim the building, and it didn't take us long to figure out how to trap them.  We were immune, I later discovered, immune to the disease that had killed most of the world's population, and to the countless diseases those horrible creatures carried.  At least their experiments were good for something.  It wasn't until much later that I discovered the true extent of what they had done to us.

She opened the door.  Blinding sunlight ripped into my eyes.  As the pain passed and my vision returned, all I saw was blue.  Blue skies as clear as they had ever been.  Everything below the sky was green - exceptlng a large gray gash, a cliff that rose over and below dense copses of vegetation that had reclaimed the landscape.  We made for the treeline; she was confldent, but, I supposed, sensible.  I had never seen more of the red ones than we had seen today, but she seemed to have good reason to think there were more of them - and, notably, more than she could handle with two large automatic weapons.  I turned my gaze to her bulbous, sinewy tricep muscles.  The world around was new and bizarre, but so was she.  

Once into the trees, she slowed.  She turned to me and let out a big sigh.  "Look, this next part id going to be hard, and, no offense, I don't think you're strong enough to handle it."  She looked through the trees toward the cliff.  "I can probably handle it for both of us, I'll carry you on my back, but it's not going to be easy to hold on for that long."

I looked at the cliff.  She wants to climb it?  With me on her back?  I suppose this surprise and doubt was written on my face, because she laughed lightly.  "Yeah, we have to go up there.  It's not too bad, I did it on the way down.  We won't be able to finish today, but we'll be able to make it to a safe stopping point."  I looked at her in doubt, and then down at her arms, muscles like pythons writhing.  She might be able to handle it. 

"Just--if you feel like you're losing your grip, like you're going to fall, you have to tell me.  Ok?  I can keep you from falling, but only if I'm expecting it, ok?  This is no joke, and it's no time for pride.  If I'm not expecting a sudden weight shift, we'll both go down.  Ok?"  She looked intently into my eyes, squinting, as if to perceive any doubt or misunderstanding

I nodded.  I felt the bones in my neck creak from the unfamiliar movement.

She was suddenly all business.  She took a rope from her satchel and began to tie it around herself, and then, in ways that might've been too personal, were I a person, to me.  Her lips smilegrimaced as she reached around me chest, almost hugging me.  

With rope twisted throughout my every crevice, she gestured that I should climb onto her back.  Further creaking accompanied my climbing.  "Remember, if you feel like you're going to have to let go, tell me, or we'll both die.  Seriously.  You're tied on tight, if I'm ready, you'll be ok.  You got it?  This is no joke."

I nodded again.  The creak was more subtle.

"Ok."

She started in on our climb.  I watched her work for a while.  Her fingers seemed to be as strong as every other part of her.  They pressed into the rock as if they were the harder.  Eventually my attention drifted to the world around and below.  We were above the trees by now, and I could just see the corner of the building in which I had lived.  The building I had never left before.  It was a strain to try to see it, so I let my eyes roll over the cliff and treetops to each side.  

It was tiring to hold on, just as she said.  However, something in my bones, something frozen and broken, just sort of locked me in.  I don't think I could've let go if I wanted to.  I drifted into something like a trance, my mind so dizzy from the spinning that it had fallen, and just laid there, staring.  

This time was not effortless for all of us.  I could feel her muscles go jagged and soft alternately, hot and sweaty between us.  Her breathing didn't speed, but it was punctuated with her efforts.  

After an amount of time that I am unable to estimate, we came to a large recess in the cliff face.  She hoisted us into it, and I saw that it was actually quite large.  Almost a cave, it reached and curved back out of sight.  At her prompting, I let go and found myself on my feet again.  I looked deeper into the cave and saw a small bag.  "We can sleep here."

She squatted over by the bag and pulled out a few items.  Soon she was warming tin cans over sterno, and I was still standing, dumbstruck by nothing in particular.  She looked up at me and smiled.  It was the first genuine, uncomplicated smile she had given me, which was the first one I had been given since...well, possibly forever.  

"C'mon."  

I squatted down by the sterno, as if it was a proper fire.  "We can sleep here tonight.  I'm too beat and too hungry to do the rest tonight.  That was pretty rough in there.  Probably even worse for you, huh?"  I didn't answer.  "Things looked pretty grim in there.  Lotta people still alive.  I guess there were probably a lot of rats, huh?  You were the only one still holding on though.  You may not get it now, but that's something to be proud of.  Surviving in there looked like it was actually pretty easy,      but what you did, monks couldn't've done it.  Anyway.

"The other blocks were the same.  Those guys weren't making it up - they had other crews around, torturing the survivors.  Haven't felt that sick in a long time.  Guess that's why I'm so hungry now."  She opened the can and handed it to me, with a spoon.  I looked at her and she nodded.  "All yours."  Inside the can were round things - beans?  I tried some.  They were sweet, and salty, and round, and didn't taste like roaches.  Yes, there were a lot of rats, but not enough.  Rats were once a week, maybe.  Roaches were every day.

Before I knew it I was scraping the bottom of a can with no beans in it.  She snurfled a laugh and pulled out another can and sat it on the sterno.  We finished around the same time.  She leaned back against the wall and let out a deep breath.  She pulled out a blanket and draped it over her legs holding one side up in a welcoming gesture.  I went and sat next to her, my legs under the blanket.  She put an arm around me and rested her head against mine.  "You're going to be ok."

I was grateful she couldn't see me anymore.  I watched the light from outside dim further and further, until the sun came into view, just above the crack of horizon I could see from the mouth of the cave.  That brief window of sky turned orange, then red, then purple, and then was gone.  She laid back, and pulled my head to her shoulder.  I tied myself into a ball against her, into her, in the crook of her arm, her shoulder a surprisingly soft pillow.  Her hand curled around behind me and held me there, as though without her, I might float away.  It felt like I might, so I was grateful.  I stared at the gap between her large breasts and felt dreams take me.

I opened my eyes to find it was still deep in the night.  I didn't move, I just let my eyes wander.  The light of the moon and stars illuminated the space.  A thought drifted by, and I grabbed it.  Her shoulder was less comfortable, less soft.  Lumpy.  I must've been so exhausted that I had exaggerated it.  I looked down at her chest again. Apparently I had exaggerated that, as well - what I had seen as a massive, powerful chest topped with full, womanly breasts was actually just slightly less narrow than mine.  Her shirt wasn't tight, it actually seemed to drape loosely over the two small mounds.  I was only fairly startled by the realization; this was not the first time I was mislead by my memory.  I made a mental note of the image, as if to make a note of the real, that I might compare to it as a benchmark.

I watched her chest rise and fall, and quickly slipped into dream again.

When I woke the next time, her shoulder was jagged and wrong.  Squishy here and pointed there.  In fact, her shoulder was gone, and my head was resting on her bag.  I opened my eyes.  It was day.  The sharp sunlight reached almost as far as where I laid.  She was standing nearby, gathering her possessions.  She smiled when she noticed my eyes open.  "Good morning.  There's some breakfast there if you're hungry."  Breakfast, I learned, was canned hash.  It was delicious.  It didn't taste like roaches.

Moments later, the can empty, I sat back against the stone again.  I looked around.  She seemed just about ready to go.  I looked up at her sharply.  Was I keeping her?  

She was starting to be able to read my mind.  "No hurry.  We can go whenever you're ready, but we can rest here for as long as you like.  It won't take long to make it the rest of the way."  I relaxed.  

I watched her coiling her rope around her forearms; with each coil, she bumped one of her large breasts.  Her tight shirt held them secure, but at the top they were exposed, and a slight jiggle was visible there.  I was staring at this for a moment, as though hypnotized, as if my eyes were slapping my mind in the face with something, and my mind just wasn't getting it.  During the night I had dreamt that she was thin, that her shirt was loose.  It had seemed so real; I recalled so clearly feeling in the dream that my conscious observation had been an illusion.  It was clear now what had happened - I had imagined her more like me; I was subconsciously relating to her, or, perhaps, sensing her relating to me.  I wasn't that different from her, I suppose I must've dreamt, she and I were really quite similar, just with different stories.  It would be a long time before I learned exactly how true that was.

I stood and nodded at her, though I was feeling very unsteady.  She gestured for mk to climb onto her back, and so I did.  She grabbed the rope and we swung out onto the cliff face.  As I had done the day before, I locked in and let my eyes wander over what they could see.  

The sun was strong and hot; she was sweating freely in moments - and so was I, for that matter, though mine felt more like a leaky, rusty tap, and hers like a dip in a pool on a summer day.  The frequent cool breezes helped, but I, at least, still felt like 

After what might've been an hour, we came to the top.  As if to draw even more attention to her strength and endurance, pulling us around the side of a large rock, to stand on the grass, involved a four foot jump, which, of course, she managed.

The grass here was patchy and short, broken by crags and scars.  It led gracefully to a thick forest a few yards away.  The sun was 

She flopped onto the ground with an exaggerated sigh.  I detached myself, and sat beside her, filled with several things.  Firstly, I didn't really know what else to do with myself; secondly, I was a bit in awe of her, and wanted to watch her every move; and finally, I simply wanted to be close to her.  She put her sweaty arm around me and gave me a playful squeeze.  "You stink, you know.  We're going to have to hose you off.  It's cool, I parked by a hot spring.  No joke.  It's not an accident, I read about it when I was researching the area."

Parked?  

She pulled out her bottle of water and pulled a long drink from it.  She handed it to me, and I sipped it.  It was warm, but even so, still softer and sweeter than the water I was used to.

Eventually, she stood and helped me up.  We made our way into the forest.  My bare feet tickled and pinched on the twigs and rocks beneath my feet.  It was a strange feeling, but they were all strange feelings.

The trees started to thin and we came to a small clearing.  On one side was a pool - a hot spring, I guessed - and on the other side was a blue van covered with patches of steel and spikes.  Despite this, had a friendly appeal.  It would've looked like a loaf of bread if it hadn't been armored.

Between these two was a tree stump and an unused fire pit.

"The first time I left the bus alone for a while, I was terrified.  I'm a bit more used to it now, but every time I return, even now, it's a relief to see it in tact."  She immediately, as if instinctively, began to get comfortable.  She unslung her weapons and bags, and unclipped her belt, laying them down in a clumsy pile beside the van - the bus, as she called it.  She digged into the side of her boot and came out with a key.  She unlocked the side door of the van and opened it wide.  She flopped down on the floor, her legs dangling outside.  For the first time, she seemed to really relax.  I stood, awkwardly, nearby, until she gestured me to come sit beside her.  I sat, awkwardly.

"Yeah, I think a bath is next.  I'm guessing some of that grime is getting close to a decade old.  It'll be nice to have a long soak."
