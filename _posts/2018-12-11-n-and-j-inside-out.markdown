##Mary and Vesuvius

Mary bent over.  The cool wind coming down the drainage pipe blew her bangs into her eyes.  She brushed them away impatiently, eager to see what was making the noise.   She was sure her dress was dipping into the mud below.  Soemthing was down there.  Something had been scaring her little orange cat.  Was it dangerous?  

It was spring.  That morning had been the first day of the new year that she had been able to open the windows.  The cool breeze through her tiny little house was a refreshing change, and it made her cuddle even closer with her cat, Vesuvius.  She had made hot cocoa and sat by the kitchen table, reading, while the sun muscled through the thick, heavy clouds.  Mary had left Suvy had been sleeping on the bed, but suddenly she heard a commotion.  

She heard growls, hisses, and then some crashes.  Mary leapt to her feet and went to the bedroom door, only to find Suvy racing around the room, chasing something small and bright yellow.  It was moving fast, and appeared to be flying, staying just out of reach for the young cat.  

It almost seemed to be teasing her, dipping in and out of reach, then bolting away as soon as Suvy would take a swing at it.

Mary said, "Hey!" and they both froze.  The little fluttery glowy thing - was it a star? - froze for an instant, and then bolted away again.  This time, however, it wasn't playing anymore; it went straight for the open window.  Suvy followed.  Mary suddenly realized Suvy was about to jump out the window.

She would be safe, Mary knew - the window was only a few feet from the ground outside, and Suvy was limber and strong, like cats always are.  But she was still young, and it made Mary nervous that she might get lost.  With a final rawr and a leap, the room was silent and still.  

Mary snapped out of her stillness.  She went to the window to see what direction they were going.  She had to go after them.  She grabbed her galoshes and put them on directly over her bare feet.  As she ran out the door, she grabbed her long coat, and put it on over her house dress as she tromped through her muddy garden and off into the woods.  

The ground was a damp mat of dead leaves and mud.  Mary had to be careful as she ran to step on exposed roots and other rough surfaces; she felt like she was hopping stones across a stream rather than running through a forest.  She caught sight of her cat, her bright orange fur a strong contrast against the deep, muted colors of the early spring.  Suvy leapt behind a tree and vanished from sight.  

Mary stepped up her pursuit, and in moments she saw Suvy cowering close to a metal drainage pipe.  She was about to pounce.  As Mary approached, she could see a dim light in the pipe.  

Mary stepped on a twig and Suvy turned, alerted out of her focus.  Suvy turned to look back into the tunnel.  Mary squatted down next to Suvy and gently rested a hand on her back, hopefully letting her know that the game was over, and now it was time to be careful.  

The wind from the pipe blew her bangs into her eyes.  Little flecks of what was probably just dirt speckled her face.  As she squinted, she realized she could see the small glowing...star?  
She consdidered it for a moment.  It wasn't running away anymore.  Was it afraid?  Was it friendly?  Was it playing, or teasing?  Was it all of these things?

She decided it was all of these things.  She realized she was smiling broadly at it.  She reached out towards it, offering her hand.  The little star reached for her and made a faint tinkling sound.  Suvy purred gently and wound herself between Mary's legs, pressing her fuzzy cheeks against her elbow, and then sat peacefully.  As if to appear nonthreatening, Suvy started washing her face.  

The star touched her fingertip.  It was warm and soft.  

##Desolatia and The Modern Girls

Bridget yanked the bandana off of her face and stood, shouting above the noise of the truck so the other girls could hear.  "LEFT!!  LEFT UP HERE!!!"  The hot desert sand stung her face as they tore through the empty streets of the city.  They had long since removed the top opf the truck - for better airflow! - but it wasn't ideal for high speed chases through the desert.

The Modern Girls were a gang, a super fun super tough gang of girls that had grown up together in the Chesterville district of Desolatia.  Desolatia had been a beautiful, vibrant city back in the olden days, but, just like the rest of Locria, the city had pretty much been falling apart for the last hundred years or so.  Being located in an enormous desert is how Desolatia had gotten its new name - it was hard to get to, and hard to leave.  Not that the girls minded.  They new just where to find adventures.

This one, though - this one was new even to them.

Katy, in the passenger seat, was looking at a map and making notes at the same time, as she always seemed to.  They were only about a half mile from home, why did she need a map??  Kell took the turn Bridget had indicated, though she had seen the little flicker disappear behind the buildings too.  She loved Bridget, but sometimes you just have to let Bridget be Bridget.  Marcy, unfortunately, wasn't so good at that.  She was sitting behind Kell, grumbling about Bridget's butt being in her face, about Bridget barking orders, and about being squished over because Bridget insisted on standing in the middle of the back seat.  

"IT WENT LEFT AGAIN!!!  KELL DID YOU HEAR ME????"  She rapped on the top of Kell's head.  Kell giggled.  Katy was charting their pursuit as accurately as their haste would allow.  

The tires squealed as Kell too4 k the turn at high speed.  Bridget collided with Marcy, which she found quite frustrating.  .  "DO YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR BUTT IN MY FACE???"
