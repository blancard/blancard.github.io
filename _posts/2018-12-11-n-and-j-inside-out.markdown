##Mary and Vesuvius

Mary bent over.  The cool wind coming down the drainage pipe blew her bangs into her eyes.  She brushed them away impatiently, eager to see what was making the noise.   She was sure her dress was dipping into the mud below.  Soemthing was down there.  Something had been scaring her little orange cat.  Was it dangerous?  

It was spring.  That morning had been the first day of the new year that she had been able to open the windows.  The cool breeze through her tiny little house was a refreshing change, and it made her cuddle even closer with her cat, Vesuvius.  She had made hot cocoa and sat by the kitchen table, reading, while the sun muscled through the thick, heavy clouds.  Mary had left Suvy had been sleeping on the bed, but suddenly she heard a commotion.  

She heard growls, hisses, and then some crashes.  Mary leapt to her feet and went to the bedroom door, only to find Suvy racing around the room, chasing something small and bright yellow.  It was moving fast, and appeared to be flying, staying just out of reach for the young cat.  

It almost seemed to be teasing her, dipping in and out of reach, then bolting away as soon as Suvy would take a swing at it.

Mary said, "Hey!" and they both froze.  The little fluttery glowy thing - was it a star? - froze for an instant, and then bolted away again.  This time, however, it wasn't playing anymore; it went straight for the open window.  Suvy followed.  Mary suddenly realized Suvy was about to jump out the window.

She would be safe, Mary knew - the window was only a few feet from the ground outside, and Suvy was limber and strong, like cats always are.  But she was still young, and it made Mary nervous that she might get lost.  With a final rawr and a leap, the room was silent and still.  

Mary snapped out of her stillness.  She went to the window to see what direction they were going.  She had to go after them.  She grabbed her galoshes and put them on directly over her bare feet.  As she ran out the door, she grabbed her long coat, and put it on over her house dress as she tromped through her muddy garden and off into the woods.  

The ground was a damp mat of dead leaves and mud.  Mary had to be careful as she ran to step on exposed roots and other rough surfaces; she felt like she was hopping stones across a stream rather than running through a forest.  She caught sight of her cat, her bright orange fur a strong contrast against the deep, muted colors of the early spring.  Suvy leapt behind a tree and vanished from sight.  

Mary stepped up her pursuit, and in moments she saw Suvy cowering close to a metal drainage pipe.  She was about to pounce.  As Mary approached, she could see a dim light in the pipe.  

Mary stepped on a twig and Suvy turned, alerted out of her focus.  Suvy turned to look back into the tunnel.  Mary squatted down next to Suvy and gently rested a hand on her back, hopefully letting her know that the game was over, and now it was time to be careful.  

The wind from the pipe blew her bangs into her eyes.  Little flecks of what was probably just dirt speckled her face.  As she squinted, she realized she could see the small glowing...star?  
She consdidered it for a moment.  It wasn't running away anymore.  Was it afraid?  Was it friendly?  Was it playing, or teasing?  Was it all of these things?

She decided it was all of these things.  She realized she was smiling broadly at it.  She reached out towards it, offering her hand.  The little star reached for her and made a faint tinkling sound.  Suvy purred gently and wound herself between Mary's legs, pressing her fuzzy cheeks against her elbow, and then sat peacefully.  As if to appear nonthreatening, Suvy started washing her face.  

The star touched her fingertip.  It was warm and soft.  

##Desolatia and The Modern Girls

Bridget yanked the bandana off of her face and stood, shouting above the noise of the truck so the other girls could hear.  "LEFT!!  LEFT UP HERE!!!"  The hot desert sand stung her face as they tore through the empty streets of the city.  They had long since removed the top opf the truck - for better airflow! - but it wasn't ideal for high speed chases through the desert.

The Modern Girls were a gang, a super fun super tough gang of girls that had grown up together in the Chesterville district of Desolatia.  Desolatia had been a beautiful, vibrant city back in the olden days, but, just like the rest of Locria, the city had pretty much been falling apart for the last hundred years or so.  Being located in an enormous desert is how Desolatia had gotten its new name - it was hard to get to, and hard to leave.  Not that the girls minded.  They new just where to find adventures.

This one, though - this one was new even to them.

Katy, in the passenger seat, was looking at a map and making notes at the same time, as she always seemed to.  They were only about a half mile from home, why did she need a map??  Kell took the turn Bridget had indicated, though she had seen the little flicker disappear behind the buildings too.  She loved Bridget, but sometimes you just have to let Bridget be Bridget.  Marcy, unfortunately, wasn't so good at that.  She was sitting behind Kell, grumbling about Bridget's butt being in her face, about Bridget barking orders, and about being squished over because Bridget insisted on standing in the middle of the back seat.  

"IT WENT LEFT AGAIN!!!  KELL DID YOU HEAR ME????"  She rapped on the top of Kell's head.  Kell giggled.  Katy was charting their pursuit as accurately as their haste would allow.  

The tires squealed as Kell took the turn at high speed.  Bridget collided with Marcy, which she found quite frustrating.  "DO YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR BUTT IN MY FACE???"

Katy looked up, a curious expression on her face, tapping her lower lip with her pen.  She spoke softly despite the roar of the engine, the squealing tires, and the impatient, fervent bickering from the back seat.  "We've been past this intersection 3 times now."

Kell turned to her.  "I'm sorry?"

Katy seemed to be startled by her attention.  "Nothing, well, it's just that, we've been past this intersection 3 times now.  First we came up from the south, and turned east; then we came back from the east and went straight through it, then after looping around, we came down from the north, and turned west, like, right now."

"That's weird.  I wonder if it likes this intersection or something."

"OH MY GOOODDDD," Marcy yelled, from the back seat.  "It doesn't *like* this intersection, it's lost, and this is like the only place it knows."

Kell considered her response in a much more calm demeanor than the one in which it was presented.  She tapped the brake and cut the wheel hard to the right to follow the little glow around another sharp turn.  The truck slid around the turn gracefully.  "Hm.  That makes sense.  But that would mean that it's not really...it's not really going anywhere."

Katy examined her notes.  "I discern no pattern whatsoever."

Marcy, perpetually frustrated, groaned.  "Did you seriously not know this???  It's just scared, it's running from us."

Bridget suddenly stopped shouting her unneccessary directions and turned to Marcy.  "It's afraid of us?"

Marcy shrugged.  "Wouldn't you be?  Four terrifying gang members chasing you in a metal monster?"

Bridget understood.  "So why are we chasing it?"

Marcy replied, "I don't know, I thought just because we're terrifying gang members and we had to keep up our rep."

Kell slowed to a gentle stop.  Katy carefully noted this.  The little glow did a little loop in the air when it noticed, and turned around.  It slowly approached the stopped truck and floated, looping and twirling 15 feet in the air in front of them.

Kell smiled.  "I don't think it was afraid."

Bridget scoffed.  "Of course it was.  Any creature from the universe would be justified to be scared of a gang like ours."

Katy disagreed.  "I think it was playing with us.  Playing chase."

Bridget did something that none of them had even considered.  She shouted, unneccessarily loudly, at the little glow.  "Hey!  Glowing Thing!  Were you afraid of us?"

The little star floated down towards them and stopped just a couple of feet in front of them.  It did a happy little twirl and a tiny loop.

Marcy's gaze was fixed, but a reluctant smile was growing on her face.  "That's not a scared twirl."

Kell gave the little star a big smile.  "I'm Kelly.  My friends call me Kell.  This is Katy, and that's Bridget and Marcy in the back.  Do you want to be in our gang?"

The little star gave a flip and a vertical jiggle.  It seemed to understand, and seemed to accept their proposal.

Marcy was giving this development serious thought.  "This could be a very positive addition to the gang.  We'll finally outnumber the Cruise Crew, and we'll have the same number of members as Donnie's Dogs."

Katy responded with her typical detached curiosity.  "Were we concerned with our roster?  Because your little sister has been asking to join for weeks."

"Now we can finally play volleyball against Donnie's Dogs," Marcy said, as if to herself.  "My sister?  No way, she's only ten."

"We started this gang when we were ten."

"Yeah!  And we've become brutal, vicious gang members in the last 5 years.  We even terrify random alien species that visit our planet," she continued, gesturing at the little star.

Bridget cocked her head and quietly responded.  "Do we though...?" she replied, watching the star continue to jiggle happily before them.

Kell spoke up.  "Ooh, I'd love it if Jenna joined.  She has so many books, we could have Gang Reading Afternoons once a week where we all read together."

Katy seemed interested.  "Would one person read aloud to the others, or would we all read separately?"

Bridget was an excellent decider.  "We'll take a vote once we swear Jenna in.  Is she at home, Marcy?"

Marcy scowled and didn't respond.  She sunk deep into her seat and crossed her arms in front of her chest.

Katy addressed the star.  "Do you want to come to Marcy's house to meet your fellow pledge?"

The little star shook vigorously from side to side.  

The girls were a little taken aback by this quite clear expression of disinterest.

Kell clarified.  "You really don't want to come with us?"

The little star shook from side to side again.

"But you do want to be our friend, right?"  

It shook vertically this time.

Marcy thought she understood.  "Is there something you want to do?"

It shook vertically again.

"Can you take us there?"

The little star did a quick loop, then started off in a northerly direction.  The girls, shocked at this sudden development, strapped themselves back in.  Kell floored the gas, peeled out the tires, and raced off to catch up with the little star.

###

Max wiped away the the thick layer of sand and dust that had accumulated on the radio.  He pulled out a tiny screwdriver from his belt and removed the back cover.  The parts inside looked decent; he could probably fix it up.  He carefully replaced the cover and put it in the pile of items he would bring back to the village.  He looked up from his work.  He felt a drop of sweat working its way down through the dust and sand that had acculumated on him.  He wiped his brow with his forearm and gazed out of the ancient wreckage of the truck he was savenging.  The valley below was dry, with hard-packed earth that was as  In the distance, past the center of the valley, he could see a band of mercs on dirt bikes raising dust clouds through the valley floor.

The mercs looked like Reapers; they wore purple and black to be recognizable. They were moving fast towards something, which was never a good sign. Kev stepped out of the shadows to have a better look.

He saw immediately what they were after. A meteorite was coming down. It was smaller than usual, but even tiny meteorites could bring in hundreds of moneys. Kev groaned when he noticed that, coming from the east, the far side of where the meteorite would hit, was another group of mercs, these ones in white and green. Cloverfield.

The Reapers saw them too. They were already drawing their weapons, getting ready for a fight.

Mercs usually traveled in packs of 5 or 10,but these groups were much larger, 20 at least. They must've seen the meteor coming down from wherever those people live.

The gunfire started. Kev finished up and packed away his things. He didn't want to get caught off guard with a fight like this going on so close.

Kev disliked mercs. They were so selfish, there was no reason for it. Everyone prospers when you share. He was drawn to them, morbidly curious, like watching a car crash or a bar fight. Or a merc fight. After meeting a couple of them at the inn at his village, he had become fascinated by their cruelty, abjectness, and dedication to their meaningless cause of self - continuation. 

He had once come across a written code of conduct for one of the merc companies. It was filled with ridiculous platitudes, glorifying violence, wealth, and individual victory : "The sword is mightier than the pen," and "Second place is the first loser."

He was still envious of them, though.  They were the only people who could really get out and see the world anymore.  In the olden days, if you were from a small village, and you wanted to move to the big city, you'd just go.  You'd get a job, find a place to live, and start a new life, maybe visit your family on weekends.  But now, villagers were viallagers forever, and city folk stayed city folk.  What he wouldn't give to move to the big city, meet all kinds of interesting people, hear about adventures, and maybe even go on a few.  In a city, there might be other kids his age.  There might even be a school he could go to, instead of just learning from whatever books he could find when he was out scavaging.  

But, until the world repaired itself, and everything went back to the way it was in the olden days, he was a villager.  He could still hang out at the pub in the inn and talk to the people who passed through - once a month or something.
