New Partner just came on.

It's tough for me to think about the early days of my heroin addiction.  They were perfect.  I don't mean that to romanticize it - it just solved a lot of problems, and it hadn't yet started to cause them.  Today, hearing songs I listened to in those days brings on a wave that washes over me with an echo of that perfection.

But, as I like to say, if you look at the things you like, you'll see what you value.  So what was perfect about it?

The world was so gentle.  Things didn't feel so rushed.  Most of the time, I'm rushing everywhere, frantically trying to escape the torture of ...what?

Accurate perception?
Painful memories?
The endless to do list, the clobber of guilt?

I like looking out the windows of the train when I'm able to not judge what I see.  Music helps, but I always feel bad having headphones on when I'm with the kids.
