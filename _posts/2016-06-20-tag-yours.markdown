The yellow glow of the street lamps was thick with summer humidity as it turned the patchy grass into shadows of itself. You stood, with friends, at the edge of that light, pants low, voice loud, tea stick lit, paraphernalia and sundries in a satchel in the deep darkness at the corner of the building. You had a weave. I was alone. You were so loud and so beautiful as I sat quietly in my window, lights off.  I fumbled with the unfamiliar feel of a flint-wheel as I tried to light the joint I had bought that afternoon.  Braids tied in the back, bare sports bra, boxers,brave.  I wanted to feel those brave arms around me, but, in those young nights, I couldn't've withstood even that thick yellow light.
