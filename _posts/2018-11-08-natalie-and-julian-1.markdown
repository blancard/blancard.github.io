One morning, Natalie and Julian, who were sister and brother, were kicked out of their house.  

"You two are driving me nuts!  Go play outside!"

It was a cool fall day, so they wore their coats as they tramped through the crinkly leaves, singing together.  Natalie was determined to find the perfect stones for a sidewalk for her fairy village, while Julian, who liked trains, was dragging the largest stick he could find, which he would discard when he found a larger one.  Natalie didn't usually let Julian contribute to her village, but, she had told him, if he found the perfect train, she would consider adding a light rail service to connect the outskirts of town to the post office.

Natalie stopped.  Julian bumped into her.  Something sparkly had caught her eye, between the treetops, high in the sky.  It was small, and twinkly, like a star, but it was moving, and moving strangely.  Darting this way and that, then slowing and drifting along, then haphazardly careening again.  Not, Natalie thought, how stars usually behave.  And it was morning.  When was the last time you saw a star in the daytime?

Julian looked where she was looking.  "Is that a plane?"

"I don't think so, it's daytime, if it were a plane, we'd be able to see the rest of it, like the wings and everything."

"So what is it?"

"I don't know.  But whatever it is, it's getting closer."

It was.  It was approaching the ground slowly and gracefully, drifting this way and that, as if it were looking for something.  "It's headed for the clearing,"  Julian shouted, dropping his stick and breaking into a run.  Natalie was startled out of her bedazzlement but his shout, and took off after him.

The clearing was only about as large as their school classroom, but they often played there, since there was a great stump for resting, a few large rocks for hopping across, and a deep gouge - created when a giant had tripped and fell over, or so Natalie had told Julian - which became a tiny pond after a hard rain.

The tiny star was indeed getting closer, but it was still wafting this way and that, like a mote of dandelion fluff.  Natalie and Julian stood still, staring at the little twinkle in awe.  

It really did seem to be moving toward them.  "Does it see us?" Julian asked.  

"No, don't be ridiculous," Natalie answered, but she wasn't actually sure.  It really did seem to be moving toward them.  "Well, actually.\.."

It floated down over their heads, and stopped, hovering just a few feet away, at eye level.

It was a little star.

It wasn't a star like you learn about in science at school, it was actually star shaped, but maybe a little chubby, and bopped and floated in the air.  

"Woah," Julian said, transfixed.  The star did a little flip, and then a loop-de-loop.

"Do you think it's.\..happy?" Natalie asked, for the first time in her life, really not knowing what she was seeing.  As if to respond, the star twinkled brightly for a moment.

Then, as if out of nowhere, the star grew dim, and fell to the ground, and laid still in the grass.

"Oh no!" the kids exclaimed, and bent down close, to see if it was ok.

"Is it dead?" Julian asked.

"I don't think so," Natalie answered.  It was much more dim, but it was still glowing slightly.  Natalie looked at Julian suddenly, and with a very serious expression.  "We have to save it."

"Ok," Julian responded, "but how?"

Natalie turned back to the tiny, dim star.  "I'm not sure.  Let's take it home and see what Mom says."

"You think it's ok to touch it?" Julian asked, but neither of them waited for an answer.  They leaned forward and each poked it gently with the tip of a finger.

No response.

It was soft and warm, like their cat's tummy.  "I think it's hurt," Natalie said, "I think it needs our help."  She scooped her hands under it, pressing into the grass, until she felt its weight and its soft warmth against her palms.  Julian leaned so close their heads were touching.  As she lifted the little star, it started to glow a little more brightly, and then a lot more brightly.  In a moment, it was even brighter than it had been before it had fallen.

Natalie and Julian held still, watching the little star pulsing light in slow waves, until it seemed to be pushing out all of its brightness, trying as hard as it could, then, when it seemed it couldn't get any brighter they felt it lifting up - lifting them up - until they were floating a few feet off the ground.

Natalie and Julian could hardly believe what was happening.  They looked at each other, and suddenly the star was shooting at top speed back out into the sky - with them along with it.  

They burst through the cool, wet clouds, shooting past the sky, into the inky darkness beyond, faster and faster, as if riding a spaceship made of the little star's light.  Natalie grabbed Julian's hand and held it tightly. She wasn't afraid, she just really loved him, or, at least, that's what she told me, later, when they got to my planet.

### Chapter 2.

They raced through new solar systems, past undiscovered planets, through interstellar clouds and nebulae and, Julian thought, maybe even a black hole. Natalie thought that you wouldn't be able to see a black hole, but she didn't know for sure.

The little star seemed to be taking them to a small green planet.  As they approached, they slowed.  Soon they were able to make out treetops, and thin strips of blue which were streams which seemed to stitch the landscape together like a tapestry of growth.

They slowed almost to a stop and touched the soft ground as gently as though they had stepped down from a stair.  They looked around.  The trees looked just the same as the trees on earth - maybe a bit smaller, and the forest a bit more dense, but if it weren't for the flight, they might not have known.  

Julian was admiring the soft light of the nearby star shining through the trees, but Natalie was looking at the star, which had gone dim and still.  

"J."

Julian ignored her.  He was enthralled by their travel, and their new environment. 

"J," she said again, and "J!" again, swatting his arm to get his attention.

"What?"

"Look."

He looked over her shoulder and saw the star, now dim and quiet.  "Natalie?"

"What?"

"Where are we?  How are we going to get home?"

Natalie looked at Julian.  He was scared.  His expression was intensifying.  "I don't know.  It's ok, no matter what happens, I'll be with you.  I promise."

"Ok.  Maybe we can find a way to power him up."

"Him?"

"The little star."

"What do you mean him, it's a little girl star."

"Maybe we can ask if we find a way to power it up."

Natalie nodded, closed her hand around the little star, and put her hand in her pocket.  She would protect it.

She looked around, for the first time really taking in her environment.  It was beautiful.  The sky was clear, the air was warm, and the landscape might've been painted by an artist.  

"Where should we go?"

Natalie set her mind to the question.  She felt the soft earth, felt the breeze, and listened for any sounds.  All she could hear was the nearby stream. "I learned in scouts that you can find people by following a river downstream, but these streams are so forky."

"Well, we could start that way and see where we end up."

"Ok, but let's keep track of the sun.  We can make little fairy flags with twigs and leaves, so we can see if we went in a circle."  She grabbed a handful of leaves, and started looking for small, fairy flag-sized twigs.

Julian reached for Natalie's hand.  She took it and squeezed it gently.  

They walked and listened.  Over the babbling brook they could occasionally hear crickets chirping, or birds singing.  This set Natalie at ease, because, as she said to Julian, "As long as you can hear the crickets, you know they aren't afraid, and if they aren't afraid, you don't have to be."  Julian squeezed her hand gratefully.

Wherever they were, it was beautiful.  The bright sun dappling through the trees and the soft crinkle of the leaves beneath their feet made the whole world seem like a twinkle, a planet of sparkles - it was a perfect home for the little star.

After a while, they spotted a man through the trees.  He was old, bald, and sitting beneath a tree.  He was reading something, but they couldn't see what.  He looked peaceful and kind, so they approached him.

As they got close, he heard their footsteps and looked up from his reading.  "Hello."  His face was deeply creased with age, and his eyebrows were so long that they disappeared into the hair on the sides of his head.  His white hair, though bald on top, was long and pulled into a bun on the back of his head. Julian wondered whether his eyebrows went all the way back to the bun.  He was wearing what looked like an old karate gi, worn thin with age and frayed at the edges.  "Who are you?"  He spoke slowly, and his peaceful demeanor inspired trust in the two kids.  He set aside the small book he had been reading, which was obviously old and worn.  As he looked up at them, his eyes seemed to twinkle.

Hesitantly, Natalie spoke.  "I'm Natalie and this is my brother Julian.  We're from - somewhere else.  Somewhere far away.  A star took us here.  But now the star is hurt, and we don't know what to do.  Can you help us?"

"Oh no, is it Kisma!?  She tore off yesterday afternoon and didn't tell anyone where she was going.  That darn star.  Where is she now?"  He leapt to his feet, as if to follow them somewhere.  His agility was surprising.

"She's here," Natalie said, reaching into her pocket, and gently cradling the little star in her hand.  She held the star out, so the old man could see.  

He leaned toward the little star, brow furrowed, and with a sigh, he spoke.  "Yes, that's her.  Thank goodness she's ok.  Thank you for taking such good care of her."

Julian spoke up.  "So - she - she's ok?  She's not dead?"

"Oh, no no no, stars can't die.  At least not like that, not so easily.  She's ok.  She's just exhausted herself.  She'll need to recharge back at the village before she regains consciousness."  He folded his hands in front of him and looked at them seriously.  "It was very brave of you to help her.  I'm sure she will thank you, but until she can, we can thank you for her.  Please accompany me back to the village.  You must be hungry and tired."

Natalie and Julian looked at each other.  After a silent agreement, the looked back at the old man.  "Ok."

The man picked up his book, and a knarled walking stick.

They began walking together.

Julian looked up at the old man.  "So you live here?"

"Yes, all my life.  Most people from Vronwyn come and visit later in life, and like it so much that they never leave.  I'm one of the few who was born here.  Kisma, too - all the stars you'll meet are all native Vronwynnians.  You will meet all kinds of people in the village, and some might seem strange.  Some even silly - sillier, even, than me.  But you have to give me your word that you won't mistreat anyone just because they're different from you, ok?"

"Ok," they said, in unison. 

"Do you promise?"

"Yes," Natalie said.  "We promise," Julian said.

"Strange as they may be, Vronwynnians are a delightful, cheery group.  I think you'll like them.  I'll introduce you around."

"What about you?" Julian asked.

"I'm sorry?"

"What's your name?"

"Ah.  I was wondering if you would ask that.  My name is... it's a bit silly."

"What is it?"

"Gronk."  They couldn't help giggling.  "Ok, you can laugh a bit.  It's a silly nickname.  But it's better than my full name."

Natalie knew Julian would ask, even though it was a little impolite.  She nudged him in the ribs with her elbow, but he ignored her.  "What's your full name?"

"Gronklamoose Percival Moopstop."  Even Gronk was laughing.

### Chapter Break

They saw a few small buildings nestled in the woods ahead.  As they got closer, they saw that it really was a tiny village - just a 2 or 3 story houses and buildings built in a circle, around a sort of small plaza.  The houses seemed to face in towards the middle, so they could only see the backs of them, but each had a small back door, a little garden, and the occasional laundry line.  As they got closer they started to see some of the villagers - beings of all shapes and sizes - but before they could get a good look, there was shouting.  A blue and white mushroom came bouncing out, shouting at the three of them, in a deep, booming voice.  

"GRONK! ARE YOU OK?  WHO ARE THESE SMALL THINGS?  ARE YOU IN DANGER??"  The mushroom bounced to a stop right in front of Julian and Natalie.  "Who are you?  Are you here to make trouble?  Don't you dare hurt Gronk, he's very skinny and boney and the gray hair, a lot of people might say he needs a bit of a trim - but he's my friend and I won't stand by while you hurt him, you got that?"

"Rumpleblump, I'd like you to meet my friends.  They've brought Kisma home to charge up.  This is Natalie, and this is Julian."

Rumpleblump eyed them warily, and then, with a suspicious squint, said, in a much quieter tone, "Are you here to eat us?"

Natalie and Julian shook their heads vigorously.  

"Are you here to eat Kisma."

Natalie and Julian shook their heads vigorously again.  

"Are you here because you want us to eat you?

Natalie and Julian shook their heads vigorously.  

He looked up at Gronk, clearly confused.  "I don't understand what's going on, Gronk.  Who are they here to eat?"

"Rumpleblump, my dear friend, they aren't here to eat anyone.  They're here because Kisma brought them here.  Kisma faded out, and they have been kind enough to return him home."

Rumpleblump turned back to them sharply.  "You know where Kisma is?"

Natalie chirped up, trying hard not to laugh at this silly little mushroom.  "Yes, he's right here!"  She carefully took the little star from her pocket and showed it to Rumpleblump.

"That's Kisma!  Gronk, take a look, this weird creature was holding Kisma in one of her flaps!"

Gronk bent down and spoke very softly to Rumpleblump.  "Listen, I have a very important job that I don't know if anyone will be able to do.  I'd like you to ask everyone in the village whether they can make two cups of tea for our guests, Natalie and Julian."

Rumpleblump whispered back.  "Gronk, you've come to the right shroom.  I myself already know how to make tea.  I can make the tea for them myself."

Gronk feigned surprise.  "You can!  Well, then, by all means, please, perhaps you can teach Zinnow how to do it, ok?  That way the entire village won't rely on only you to make their tea."

"You are nearly my intellectual equal, Gronk."  He bounced away.  Natalie and Julian soon heard his round, voluminous voice boldly announcing his every movement to, presumably, Zinnow, whoever that was.  "Next I will move my arm thusward..."

Gronk sighed and looked at them.  "Our village is a wonderful place to live.  Some of our residents are less wonder and more full.  Come.  I'll show you how the Starlians recharge."

The path led through an archway, decorated with lights and winding vines.  As they entered the village proper, they saw that it was quite a bustling place.  Many of the houses had storefronts or eateries, and residents of all shapes and sizes buzzed about.  Natalie noticed that there were many other stars, all of them darting and wafting as Kisma had.  There were fruit-people, talking animals, one person that appeared to be made of purple smoke, and even a glob of goo with a handbag.  Julian even spotted two plants having a snack at a cafe.  

Two little stars floated down to Natalie, and started hovering around her pocket.  Gronk smiled.  "It seems Hattie and Joosh have found their friend.  These are Natalie and Julian, Kisma brought them here and then promptly faded out.  They've taken good care of her."  The two little stars seemed to twinkle appreciatively.

Julian noticed Rumpleblump by a large fountain in the center of the plaza, forcefully demonstrating his tea-making technique to the timid glob of goo carrying the handbag.  "Next I use my arm to place the kettle onto the heat.  Can you do arms?  Well, you're going to need to be able to do arms to do this.  Hey, you've got that bag there, so, however you're holding that bag, do that, but with this.  Got it?"

Julian was enjoying watching all the different creatures interacting.  A two-legged golden retriever was buying a sandwich from a talking sandwich tree; two tiny fairies pulled a drink from a cooler and placed it next to his plate.  A tall stack of papers was talking spiritedly to a 5-foot banana, who was listening with a deeply interested expression.  The purple smoke creature was gesturing to a shopkeeper, miming something Julian didn't understand.  The shopkeeper, who looked like a life-sized teddy bear, was picking up item after item, trying to figure out what his customer wanted.  The plaza was abuzz with talk and laughter and exhuberance, and, as Natalie had noticed, many, many other tiny stars.

Natalie, on the other hand, was preoccupied otherwise.  The two little stars were nudging her hand, trying to get her to extricate Kisma from her jacket pocket.  As she did so, their excitement was obvious, even without words.  They flipped and bopped around, and soon they were trying to push her along toward the center of the plaza. Gronk encouraged her to follow their lead.  She made sure to take Julian by the hand as they moved through the crowd toward the fountain.

As they approached, she could see that it wasn't a fountain at all - or, rather, what was running through the fountain wasn't water.  A blue, glowing light seemed to flow from the top of the fountain down into the base, where, she could see, there were dozens of tiny stars floating along, like kids in a pool.  Hattie and Joosh dropped right in, and looked up at Natalie expectantly.  

"Place Kisma into the fountain," Gronk said.

Natalie slowly lowered her hand into the blue light.  She felt a light tingle when she touched it.  She took her hands away and the dim little star seemed to float in the strange fountain.  Julian, whose attention had returned, and Natalie, noticed faint electricity, like tiny shocks of lightning, throughout the dim little star.  Within moments, it seemed to fill with the same yellow light as the others.  Suddenly it twitched, shook, and zoomed to life, wiggling and bouncing happily, as though it had never been dim.

Julian and Natalie looked at each other, happily; Julian even clapped a little.  Gronk smiled and spoke.  "It will take a few hours for her to be fully charged, she'll have to remain near the fountain until then."

Natalie and Julian watched the fountain and the little stars for a moment, until Julian turned to Natalie and tugged her sleeve.  She understood.

"Gronk?"

"Yes?"

"How can we go home?"

Gronk looked at her seriously.  "Any of the starlians can take you home, but I'm afraid there's only one that will know where that is."

### Chapter break

Hot tears started flowing down Julian's cheeks - but he refused to make a sound.  Natalie sat and pulled him onto her lap, and held his head to her shoulder.  She spoke quietly to him, telling him they would be ok.  He knew it, but he still couldn't always stop tears.  He blinked hard and watched the village.

In a corner, he saw two people talking - two _human_ people.
