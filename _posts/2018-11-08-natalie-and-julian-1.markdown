Natalie, Julian, and the Little Star

One morning, Natalie and Julian, who were sister and brother, were kicked out of their house.  

"You two are driving me nuts!  Go play outside!"

It was a cool fall day, so they wore their coats as they tramped through the crinkly leaves, singing together.  Natalie was determined to find the perfect stones for a sidewalk for her fairy village, while Julian, who liked trains, was dragging the largest stick he could find, only to drop them when he found a larger one.  Natalie didn't usually let Julian contribute to her village, but she had told him, if he found the perfect train, she would consider adding a light rail service to connect the outskirts of town to the post office.

Natalie stopped.  Julian bumped into her.  She saw something unusual in the sky.  It was like a star, but it was moving - and it was morning.

Julian saw it too.  "Is that a plane?"

"I don't think so, it's daytime, if it were a plane, we'd be able to see it."

"So what is it?"

"I'm not sure.  But it's getting closer."

It was.  It was approaching the ground slowly and gracefully, drifting this way and that, as if it were looking for something.  "It's headed for the clearing,"  Julian shouted, dropping his stick and breaking into a run.  Natalie was startled out of her bedazzlement but his shout, and took off after him.

The clearing was only about as large as their school classroom, but they often played there, since there was a great stump for resting, a few large rocks for hopping across, and a deep gouge - created when a giant had tripped and fell over, or so Natalie had told Julian - which became a tiny pond after a hard rain.

The tiny star was indeed getting closer, but it was still wafting this way and that, like a mote of dandelion fluff.  Natalie and Julian stood still, staring at the little twinkle in awe.  

It really did seem to be moving toward them.  "Does it see us?" Julian asked.  

"No, don't be ridiculous," Natalie answered, but she wasn't actually sure.  It really did seem to be moving toward them.  "Well, maybe..."

It floated down over their heads, and stopped, hovering just a few feet away, at eye level.

It was a tiny star.

It wasn't a star like you learn about in science at school, it was actually star shaped, but maybe a little chubby, and bopped and floated in the air.  

"Woah," Julian said, transfixed.  The star did a little flip, and then a loop-de-loop.

"Do you think it's...happy?" Natalie asked, for the first time in her life, really not knowing what she was seeing.  As if to respond, the star twinkled brightly for a moment.

Then, as if out of nowhere, the star grew dim, and fell to the ground, and laid still in the grass.

"Oh no!" the kids exclaimed, and bent down close, to see if it was ok.

"Is it dead?" Julian asked.

"I don't think so," Natalie answered.  It was much more dim, but it was still glowing slightly.  Natalie looked at Julian suddenly, and with a very serious expression.  "We have to save it."

"Ok," Julian responded, "but how?"

Natalie turned back to the tiny, dim star.  "I'm not sure.  Let's take it home and see what Mom says."

"You think it's ok to touch it?" Julian asked, but neither of them waited for an answer.  They leaned forward and each poked it gently with the tip of a finger.

No response.

It was soft, and warm, like their cat's tummy.  "I think it's hurt," Natalie said, "I think it needs our help."  She scooped her hands under it, pressing into the grass, until she felt its weight and its soft warmth against her palms.  Julian leaned so close their heads were touching.  As she lifted the little star, it started to glow a little more brightly, and then a lot more brightly.  In a moment, it was even brighter than it had been before it had fallen.

Natalie and Julian held still, watching the little star pulsing light in slow waves, until it seemed to be pushing out all of its brightness, trying as hard as it could, then, when it seemed it couldn't get any brighter they felt it lifting up - lifting them up - until they were floating a few feet off the ground.

Natalie and Julian could hardly believe what was happening.  They looked at each other, and suddenly the star was shooting at top speed back out into the sky - with them along with it.  

They burst through the cool, wet clouds, shooting past the sky, into the inky darkness beyond, faster and faster, as if riding a spaceship made of the little star's light.  Natalie grabbed Julian's hand and held it tightly. She wasn't afraid, she just really loved him, or, at least, that's what she told me, later, when they got to my planet.

Chapter 2.

They raced through new solar systems, past undiscovered planets, through interstellar clouds and nebulae and, Julian thought, maybe even a black hole. Natalie thought that you wouldn't be able to see a black hole, but she didn't know for sure.

The little star seemed to be taking them to a small green planet.  As they approached, they slowed.  Soon they were able to make out treetops, and thin strips of blue which were streams which seemed to stitch the landscape together like a tapestry of growth.

They slowed almost to a stop and touched the soft ground as gently as though they had stepped down from a stair.  They looked around.  The trees looked just the same as the trees on earth - maybe a bit smaller, and the forest a bit more dense, but if it weren't for the flight, they might not have known.  

Julian was admiring the soft light of the nearby star shining through the trees, but Natalie was looking at the star, which had gone dim and still.  

"J."

Julian ignored her.  He was enthralled by their travel, and their new environment. 

"J," she said again, and "J!" again, swatting his arm to get his attention.

"What?"

"Look."

He looked over her shoulder and saw the star, now dim and quiet.  "Natalie?"

"What?"

"Where are we?  How are we going to get home?"

Natalie looked at Julian.  He was scared.  His expression was intensifying.  "I don't know.  It's ok, no matter what happens, I'll be with you.  I promise."

"Ok.  Maybe we can find a way to power him up."

"Him?"

"The little star."

"What do you mean him, it's a little girl star."

"Maybe we can ask if we find a way to power it up."

Natalie nodded, closed her hand around the little star, and put her hand in her pocket.  She would protect it.

She looked around, for the first time really taking in her environment.  It was beautiful.  The sky was clear, the air was warm, and the landscape might've been painted by an artist.  

"Where should we go?"

Natalie set her mind to the question.  She felt the soft earth, felt the breeze, and listened for any sounds.  All she could hear was the nearby stream. "I learned in scouts that you can find people by following a river downstream to find people, but these streams are so forky."

"Well, we could start that way and see where we end up."

"Ok, but let's keep track of the sun.  We can make little fairy flags with twigs and leaves, so we can see if we went in a circle."  She grabbed a handful of leaves, and started looking for small, fairy flag-sized twigs.

Julian reached for NAtalie's hand.  She took it and squeezed it gently.
