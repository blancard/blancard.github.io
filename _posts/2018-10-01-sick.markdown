Due, surely, to some corporate shit trying to save money, my flight is delayed.  I'm sitting here with my good-natured 3yo son, whose good-naturedness surely as a limit, which I may see today, waiting for who the fuck knows what.  

Baudelaire talked about Spleen.  It was his word for the revulsion he felt when witnessing humanity.  I know that feeling very well, but I'm realizing that I've spent years now without it, innoculated by surrounding myself with people that I love, and now that I'm stuck here with nothing to distract me from the base capitalism that these people find normal, and worse, acceptable.
