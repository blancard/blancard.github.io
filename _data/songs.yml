    For Matt Wells.  He and I took a very slooow bus from Boulder Colorado to NYC.  He saw a pretty girl in a truck stop and decided he wanted to stay with her in Nebraska forever.</p>
    <p>I actually had to trick him to get him back on the bus, but he was super drunk so it was easy.  I was super drunk too so that made it harder.</p>
    <p>He ended up writing a nice little book of poems about it.  I wrote this silly song about it.  My song is filled with lies but this description revealed the truth of it so everything has turned out ok.</p>
    <p>He died a few years ago.</p>

- title: The Watching Trains Song
  mp3: watchingtrainssong

- title: Willis
  mp3: willis
  text: This song actually is a metaphor.  Or is it?  Actually, I don't think it is, I just changed my friends name, as a SO SUBTLE reference to Wesley Willis, who, like my friend, was frequently suffering because of schizophrenia.
